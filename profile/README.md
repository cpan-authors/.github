# Introducion

This organization has been setup to provide a place for CPAN authors to collaborate more easily.

Members of the organization may more easily give out permissions than they could normally do so under their personal github profile. All repositories here are public. 

Members who create or transfer in a repository will be the admin on that repository. Github will automatically redirect both fetch and http queries to your old repo location.

Enjoy!

# How to join:

1. Contact the admin for this organization.
2. Reach out to us in [#github-cpan-authors](https://perlfoundation.slack.com/archives/C05Q03HNQ76/p1693263853924999) on TPF Slack
