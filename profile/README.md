# Introduction

This organization has been set up to provide a place for CPAN authors to collaborate more easily.

Members of the organization may more easily give out permissions than they could normally do under their personal GitHub profile. All repositories here are public. 

Members who create or transfer in a repository will be the admin on that repository. GitHub will automatically redirect both fetch and HTTP queries to your old repo location.

Enjoy!
